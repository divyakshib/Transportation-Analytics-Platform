# Transportation-Analytics-Platform
Solves the problem of absence of proper public transportation or certain facilities by clustering the location of maximum demand. Data or service request is collected and plotted for analyses that finds the most dense and frequent location and solution can be provided on the bases of this graph.
Analysing data collected from various location of requested location into a clustered graph that is colour coded according to frequency of mean requests in nearby areas to solve transportation problem, suggest optimal location for business expansion and predict best routes for new public transportation.
